### FreyAI - An invented start-up 
## Hi there!

For our class in Entrepreneurship in Life Sciences at EPFL, we, a group of 4 EPFL students, created a fictive company called FreyAI. FreyAI leverages the power of AI for early endometriosis diagnosis through Alerta, the first AI-based endometriosis diagnosis software. 

On this repository you will find the code underlying the website of FreyAI. This project was awarded the Best Group Pitch Award.
